# UnstackDecks

Scans your inventory for stacks of Stacked Deck items and unstacks them into Divination cards. 

*Note - This has been minimally tested as I don't have many stacked decks to test with and I play in a non-trade league.*

## Usage

Press the hotkey you assigned to trigger the unstacking of Stacked Decks. As long as you have a location in your inventory where a div card can be dropped, it will unstack.

## Settings

* Enable - Determines whether to listen for hotkey presses.
* UnstackHotkey - The hot key that triggers unstacking.
* ExtraDelay - An extra delay used in various places.
* TimeBetweenClicks - A delay between unstacking and stacking div cards.
* MouseSpeed = The speed the cursor moves around the screen. (Not tested)
* PreserveOriginalCursorPosition - Moves the cursor back to its original location when operations are completed.
* ReverseMouseButtons - Flips the mouse buttons so left-click unstacks and right-click drops the div card. For left-handed mouse users.
